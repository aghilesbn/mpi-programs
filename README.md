# MPI Programs

This repository contains a collection of educational MPI (Message Passing Interface) programs written in C.

The goal of this project is to learn and demonstrate basic parallel programming concepts such as:
- Process creation and ranks
- Point-to-point communication (MPI_Send, MPI_Recv)
- Collective communication
- Synchronization between processes

Each program is placed in its own folder under `src/` and comes with a dedicated README file explaining how to compile and run it.

## Requirements
- An MPI implementation (OpenMPI or MPICH)
- A C compiler (gcc)
- mpicc available in your PATH


## Compile and Run
See the README file inside each program folder for specific instructions.

## Author
**Mouheb Hadbi** – This program is part of my OpenMP educational projects demonstrating the race condition problem.
